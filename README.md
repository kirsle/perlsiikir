# PerlSiikir

This is a source code dump of the Perl version of my Siikir CMS, which was
originally written to power siikir.com and was later adapted to run kirsle.net
and rivescript.com

A more fitting name for this codebase would be "Legacy Siikir," as this code
doesn't power Siikir anymore.

**This code is abandoned.** It will not be getting any feature additions,
security fixes, or anything from me. I'm releasing it *only* so that I don't
lose its source code, and for others to look at.

**This is not FOSS software.** It's not released under the GNU General Public
License. Having access to this source code does *not* include a license to run
it for your own website. If you want to run a website similar to kirsle.net
(with a blog and photo albums etc.), use my newer
[Rophako CMS](https://github.com/kirsle/rophako), which is what had replaced
PerlSiikir for powering kirsle.net specifically.

**NO WARRANTY.** This is a code dump and comes with no support.
