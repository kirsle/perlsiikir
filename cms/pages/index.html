<h1>Welcome to PerlSiikir</h1>

This is a web CMS framework called PerlSiikir... although a more fitting name
would be "Legacy Siikir", as this project has been abandoned and will not be
getting any more updates.<p>

Its source code has been released only because I don't want to lose all the
work that went into this CMS over the previous years. I took the old codebase,
swapped out the HTML template and removed Kirsle.net- and Siikir.com-specific
pages.<p>

I abandoned this code in favor of a rewrite in Python for numerous reasons.
This Perl code has memory leaks that I don't care to fix anymore, it's a pain
in the ass to install it on a new server, and its code has become somewhat
messy here and there.<p>

This source code release <strong>does not</strong> give you a license to run
this code on your site. It's here for looking at only. It's not released under
an open source license like the GPL or anything.<p>
